1 Overview

Social networks are fast becoming the dominant platform for communication online, with many of you likely
holding accounts on half-a-dozen networks or more. Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google+, Foursquare, Renren,
Tencent Weibo, Vkontakte are a few of the very many social networks in use today.
Several aspects of online social networks oer unique insights into users: friendships or connections between
users as represented by the social graph; location data of users which often varies as many prefer mobile access
to social networks; prole and post content which can be quite voluminous and reveal much about users.
The interest of companies and governments in online social networks is largely due to the potential insights
that can be gained. On one hand, advertising on social networks can be highly eective and is worth billions;
on the other, user's privacy can be breached by unexpected access to data, or by insights that machine learning
can derive from what is published intentionally. It is clear that machine learning is an important tool for social
network analysis, and for any activity that derives value from social networks. In this project you will explore
how machine learning can be used to make predictions on social network data.
Your task: In this project, your task is to predict user locations for a test set of 1,000 users. For a large
number of users from a real social network (57,562 total), you have access to the social graph (undirected
friendships between users, including the test users) and limited prole information on all users: the rst, second
and third most common hours of the day they post and the number of posts made. For all but the test users
you will be given the latitude-longitude coordinates most common among each user's posts. Your task is to
predict both coordinates for each of the test users.
